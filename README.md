Caesar Cipher - Mini Project
Description
This mini-project is a simple GUI application that allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions down the alphabet.

Features
Encryption and Decryption: Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters. Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
User-friendly Interface: Built using Python's tkinter library, providing a simple graphical user interface.
